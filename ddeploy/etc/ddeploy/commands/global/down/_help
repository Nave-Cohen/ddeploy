ddeploy down - Stop and remove Docker containers associated with a ddeploy project.

Usage: ddeploy down [project-name | all]

Arguments:
- project-name: The folder path of the specific ddeploy project to stop and remove containers from.
- all: Stop and remove containers from all ddeploy projects.

Note:
- The 'ddeploy down' command is used to stop and remove Docker containers associated with a ddeploy project.
- If 'project-name' is provided, the script will stop and remove containers from the specified ddeploy project.
- If 'all' is provided, the script will stop and remove containers from all ddeploy projects.
- Ensure that you have proper permissions to manage Docker containers and that you are in the ddeploy project's base directory to use this command.
- Be cautious when using the 'all' option, as it will stop and remove containers from all ddeploy projects, and data loss may occur if not handled properly.
