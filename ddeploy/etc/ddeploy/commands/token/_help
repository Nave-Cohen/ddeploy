This command is used to set a GitHub token for auto-rebuilding on a new commit.

Usage: 
$ ddeploy token
$ (prompt) Enter token: [Your token]

Note: The provided token should have appropriate permissions to access the repository.

If the token is valid and can successfully fetch the commit information, it will be added to the configuration file. Otherwise, an error message will be displayed.
